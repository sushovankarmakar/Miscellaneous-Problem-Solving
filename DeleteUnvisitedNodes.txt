You are given a linked list and you visit the nodes in the following manner -

When you are at a node you visit the Kth node after that, where K is the value of that node.
If there are less than K nodes after a particular node then you reach NULL.
You stop when you reach NULL.
Initially, you are at the head.
You have to delete all the unvisited nodes in the linked list.

Input Format

First-line contains N, the number of nodes in the linked list. Second line contains N space separated integers, the value of the ith node in the linked list.

Constraints

Output Format

Print the linked list after deleting all the unvisited nodes.

Initially, you are at the head (Node with value 1). So you move to the 1st node after that, which is the node with value 2.

From node 2 you visit the 2nd node after that which is the node with value 1.

In a similar way, you go to the second last node (value 2).

From there since there are less than 2 nodes you reach NULL and stop.

So, the visited nodes are 1, 2, 1 and 2.
