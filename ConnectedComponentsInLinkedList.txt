You are given head, the head node of a linked list containing unique integer values.

You are also given an array A of M distinct integer , whose values are present in the linked list.

Return the the head of linked list of all connected components in A , where two values are connected if they appear consecutively in the linked list.

Input Format

N

N integers (linked list)

M

M integers(array A)

Constraints

1 <= N <= 100000

0 <= data of linked list <= 10^9

1 <= M <= N

A[i] is also exists in linked list.

Output Format

Print all linked list which are returned each in a new line.

Sample Input 0

8
0 1 2 5 4 3 6 7
6
0 1 4 3 5 7
Sample Output 0

0 1 
5 4 3 
7 
Explanation 0

0 and 1 are consecutive integers in the linked list and they are also present in array A so they form a connected component.

Similarly 5 4 3 are consecutive integers in the linked list and they are also present in array A so they form a connected component.

7 is also present in array A so it form a connected component with single node.
