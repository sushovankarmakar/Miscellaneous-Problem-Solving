Unfortunately, you only remember the 3 largest amounts of money taken from a particular friend.

You have to find the amount of money and the friend who you have to repay the most.

Input format
First line contains T - Number of test cases.

First line of each test case contains N - Number of times money is borrowed.

Next N lines contain a string S and an integer M - The name of friend & the amount borrowed.

Output format
Print the friend's name and the amount of money that you have to pay him.

Constraints
T <= 100

N <= 50000

1 <= M <= 1000000000

1<= |S| <=10, |S|=Length of string

S can contain both lowercase and uppercase characters

Sum of lengths of string over all test cases <= 500000
