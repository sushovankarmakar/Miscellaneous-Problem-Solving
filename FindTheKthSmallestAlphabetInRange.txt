Find the Kth smallest alphabet in the range


Problem Description
Given a string S and 3 integers - L,R and K.

L and R specifying the range in the string.

You have to find the Kth smallest alphabet(lexicographically) in the range.

There will be Q queries.

Input format
First line contains 2 integers N, Q - Length of string and queries respectively.

Second line contains a string S of length N.

Next Q lines contain 3 space separated integers L,R and K.

Output format
Print the Kth smallest alphabet

Sample Input 1
10 4

helloworld

1 4 2

1 4 3

1 10 9

3 8 6

Sample Output 1
h

l

r

w

Explanation 1
In the first query, the range contains 4 letters {h,e,l,l} and 2nd smallest being 'h' lexicographically.

Constraints
N <= 50000

Q <= 50000

1 <= L<=R <=N

1 <= K <= (R-L+1)

The string contains only lowercase english alphabet
